# undo-redo-elm

An implementation of drawing with undo and redo in the [Elm programming language](http://elm-lang.org/).
This is one of several implementations I've written:

* [Undo + Redo in ClojureScript](http://www.macwright.org/2016/02/07/undo-redo-clojurescript.html)
* [Undo + Redo in JavaScript with Immutable.js](http://www.macwright.org/2015/05/18/practical-undo.html)

## Development

This requires Elm to develop. I use [elm-reactor](http://elm-lang.org/get-started#elm-reactor)
to compile the code: run `elm-reactor` in the git checkout and click on `App.elm`.
